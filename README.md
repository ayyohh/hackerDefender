You are just browsing the internet when suddenly, are start getting HACKED!

A violent onslaught of binary floods the screen and you are the only who cares enough about your machince to stop the attack at any cost.

The binary forces will spawn in the center of the screen and spread out, it's your duty to make sure none of the binary hit the edge of your browser screen or your battleship, for that will be your doom.

                                             Have fun!
